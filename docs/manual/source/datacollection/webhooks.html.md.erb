Webhooks are used to collects data for your application from multiple channels automatically.

Apache PredictionIO (incubating) offers webhooks for Segment.io and MailChimp
(backend only). Several users also have expressed interest in Magento, Shopify
and KeenIO so we'd be happy to help if anyone wishes to implement these.
