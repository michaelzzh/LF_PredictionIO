[//]: # (## Method 1: Quick Install)

[//]: # (```)
[//]: # ($ bash -c "$(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apache/incubator-predictionio/master/bin/install.sh)")

[//]: # (<%= partial 'shared/install/proceed_template' %>)

## Manual Install

[//]: # (If you do not want to use the Quick Install script, you can follow the steps)
[//]: # (below to setup Apache PredictionIO (incubating) and its dependencies. In these)
[//]: # (instructions we will assume you are in your home directory. Wherever you see)
[//]: # (`/home/abc`, replace it with your own home directory.)

Follow the steps below to setup Apache PredictionIO (incubating) and its
dependencies. In these instructions we will assume you are in your home
directory. Wherever you see `/home/abc`, replace it with your own home
directory.

### Java

Ensure you have an appropriate Java version installed. For example:

```
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_40"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_40-b25)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.40-b25, mixed mode)
```


### Download Apache PredictionIO (incubating)

Download Apache PredictionIO (incubating) and extract it.

```
$ cd
$ pwd
/home/abc
$ wget http://download.prediction.io/PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>.tar.gz
$ tar zxvf PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>.tar.gz
```

NOTE: Download instructions above apply to previous non-Apache releases only.
Once we have made an Apache release, new instructions will be provided.

### Installing Dependencies

Let us install dependencies inside a subdirectory of the Apache PredictionIO
(incubating) installation. By following this convention, you can use
PredictionIO's default configuration as is.

```
$ mkdir PredictionIO-<%= data.versions.pio %>/vendors
```


#### Spark Setup

<%= partial 'shared/install/spark' %>


#### Elasticsearch Setup

WARNING: You may skip this section if you are using PostgreSQL or MySQL.

<%= partial 'shared/install/elasticsearch' %>


#### HBase Setup<a class="anchor" name="hbase">&nbsp;</a>

WARNING: You may skip this section if you are using PostgreSQL or MySQL.

<%= partial 'shared/install/hbase' %>


In addition, you must set your environment variable `JAVA_HOME`. For example, in
`/home/abc/.bashrc` add the following line:

```
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-oracle
```


<%= partial 'shared/install/dependent_services' %>

Now you have installed everything you need!
