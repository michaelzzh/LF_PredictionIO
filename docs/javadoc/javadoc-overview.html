    PredictionIO API Documentation

  <p>
    If you are building a prediction engine, the most interesting package would
    be <a
    href="{@docRoot}/org.apache.predictionio/controller/java/package-summary.html">org.apache.predictionio.controller.java</a>
    and <a
    href="{@docRoot}/org.apache.predictionio/data/store/java/package-summary.html">org.apache.predictionio.data.store.java</a>
    You may also want to look at <a
    href="{@docRoot}/org.apache.predictionio/controller/package-summary.html">org.apache.predictionio.controller</a>,
    as some functionality, such as custom model persistence {@link
    org.apache.predictionio.controller.PersistentModel}, are provided directly by that
    package.
